          </h1>
          <p>The real project usually starts with obtaining data. No matter text mining, machine learning, and data
            mining, all need data. At this time, web scraping is particularly essential for data collection.
            Fortunately,
            Python provides excellent web scraping frameworks -- Scrapy, which can not only scrape the data but also get
            and clean the data. This article discusses and analyzes the technology framework, architecture composition,
            operation process, and application examples of Scrapy. This paper expounds the significance and future of it
            in the data-driven project, and also discusses its existing shortcomings and influences.</p>

          </h1>
          <p>Web scraping is a crucial way to prepare data and is often used to collect data from the network in daily
            esystems. This article will discuss a robust web scraping framework, Scrapy.
            Scrapy is a fast high-level web crawling[1] and web scraping framework used to crawl websites and extract
            structured data from their pages. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to
            monitoring
            and automated testing[2].</p>

              Downloader Middlewares (optional, mainly User_Agent, Proxy Agent).</li>
            <li>Downloader sends a request to the Internet and receives a download response.Give the response to Spiders
              via ScrapyEngine, SpiderMiddlewares.</li>
            <li>Spiders processes the response, extracts the data, and gives it to ItemPipeline by ScrapyEngine.</li>
            <li>The extracted URL is given back to Scheduler by ScrapyEngine for the next loop. The program stops until

          </h1>
          <p>The Scrapy framework, which integrates the general functions of web page collection into each module and
            leaves out the customized part, liberates the programmer from the tedious process of repeated work. The
            focus
            of simple web page scraper is to deal with anti-scraping, large-scale scraping, and efficient and stable
            scraping. On the other hand, Scrapy uses the Twisted framework to handle network communications, I/O
            performance is improved, and CPU usage is reduced.</p>
          <h3>
            <a id="user-content-twisted-framework" class="anchor" href="#twisted-framework" aria-hidden="true"><svg
                class="octicon octicon-link" viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"
                aria-hidden="true">
              </svg></a><strong>Twisted framework</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>Using Twisted efficient asynchronous network framework to handle network communication. Twisted provides
            methods that allow the above operations to be performed without blocking code execution. Figure 2 shows a
            comparison of twisted and multithreaded code.
            <img
              src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/502e8e7739c8ff254d63efc888dd65fce137deef/68747470733a2f2f696d672d626c6f672e6373646e2e6e65742f3230313630343131313632323230343930"
              alt="Figure 2" data-canonical-src="https://img-blog.csdn.net/20160411162220490" style="width:100%; margin:0 auto"></br>
            Figure 2. The comparison of twisted and multithreaded</p>
          <p>The developers of the operating system have been optimizing the thread operation for decades, and the
            performance problem is not as significant as before. However, compared with multithreaded programming, it is
            tough to write thread safe code, so twisted code is far simpler and safer than the multithreaded code.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, Scrapy is asynchronous, flexible in adjusting the number of concurrent requests, and
            can improve data mining efficiency by replacing regular expressions with more readable xpaths[5]. Moreover,
            when writing middleware, uniform complementary filters can be used to make the data more accurate and clean.
            It is more convenient to use Scrapy to get data on different URLs at the same time. Besides, it is more
            convenient to debug independently because it supports the shell approach. Finally, the data is stored in the
            database by pipeline, which makes the storage of data more flexible.</p>
          <p>However, there are some shortcomings, such as the inability to use it to complete distributed data
            extraction, high memory consumption, and no effect on Web pages that execute Javascript. On the other hand,
            due to base on the Twisted framework, an exception to one task does not stop the other task, and another
            exception handling is difficult to detect.</p>
          <p>In data-driven projects such as big data and machine learning, data preparation is essential and an
            important
            part that cannot be ignored[6]. More and more technologies are being used to prepare databases, and a
            crucial
            part of them is to collect data from the network. Compared with traditional web scraping frameworks, Scrapy
            has received considerable attention and use in many web scraping frameworks due to its simple programming
            and
            flexible deployment.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Many companies have customized scraping frameworks base on Scrapy to complete data collection,
            and
            many extensions have also achieved considerable success on GitHub. Such as, Scrapy_redis solves the issue of
            distributed scraping. Scrapy-splash, which integrates JavaScript and can execute JS in Scrapy.</p>

          </h1>
          <p>In a data-driven environment, data preparation has become an important task, and web scraping has become a
            significant way of data collection. Scrapy provides a convenient development environment for data mining,
            machine learning, and other research and practice. By using the Twisted framework, the efficiency of network
            communication is improved, and the consumption of computing resources is reduced. Scrapy's architecture, on
            the one hand, reduces the number of time developers spend on code, allowing developers more time to design
            and
            improve crawler's anti-crawling capabilities, data compilation. On the other hand, it offers developers
            ample
            customized components and interfaces. Although it is criticized for its memory consumption and its inability
            to analyze JS code, more esystems can be used with Scrappy to solve these issues. Scrapy plays a vital role
            in
            future data mining and data preparation tasks.</p>
